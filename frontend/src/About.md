This is a website that aims to automatically rank the top college football
games each week by how entertaining they are to watch. We know how much it
sucks feeling drunk and bitter at the end of yet another no-score Alabama and
Clemson game. Not only that, but we despise when we only hear about the 7-OT
LSU and A&M game when that asshole Greg spoils the score. That's why CFB Game
of The Week's algorithm reviews the games after they happen and tells you which
replays to watch: spoiler-free.
